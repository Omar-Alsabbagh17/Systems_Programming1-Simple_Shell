# Simple Shell 

The goal of this project is to understand important UNIX system calls by implementing a simple shell called sshell.\
A shell is a command-line interpreter: it accepts input from the user under the form of command lines and executes them. Well-known UNIX shells include for example bash (default shell on Ubuntu) and zsh (default shell on MacOS). \


### This shell implementation will provide the following set of core features:

Execution of user-supplied commands with optional arguments \
Selection of typical builtin commands \
Redirection of the standard output of commands to files \
Composition of commands via piping \
Redirection of the standard error of commands to files or pipes \
Simple ls-like builtin command \
